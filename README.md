## Interface

(_.c.f._ [The Representer Interface][automated-analysis-representer-interface])

The `/opt/representer/bin/run.sh` script that the docker image runs receives two parameters:

1. the test slug
2. the input directory namestring. This directory contains the submitted code.
2. the output directory namestring. This directory will be writable.


The script *MUST* write the following files to the directory:

1. `representation.txt`: a normalized representation of the submitted code. All symbols must be replaced by generated symbols.
2. `mapping.json`: maps the generated symbols in `representation.txt` to the original symbols.

The output of the script *MAY* write the following files to the directory:

1. `representation.out`: any information that may want to view later for debugging.

The script *MAY* produce output to `stdout` and `stderr` which will be persisted for later.
